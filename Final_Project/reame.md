Becasuse directly revise the PDDLStream source code is challenging, I used it as a planner to solve my sussman anomaly probelm. For the detail of how to use PDDLStream please refer to their github: https://github.com/caelan/pddlstream . 

The sussman_pddlstream.py file showed complete workflow, the sussman_simple_example.py only shows how to move blocks.

requirements: pybullet, pybullet_data
